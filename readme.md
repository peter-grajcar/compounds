> ### IR-5.2 STOICHIOMETRIC NAMES OF ELEMENTS AND BINARY COMPOUNDS
>
> When constructing a stoichiometric name for a binary compound, one element is
> designated as the electropositive constituent and the other the electronegative constituent.
> The electropositive constituent is by convention the element that occurs last in the sequence
> of Table VI\* and its name is the unmodified element name (Table I). The name of the
> electronegative constituent is constructed by modifying the element name with the ending
> ‘ide’, as explained in detail for monoatomic anions in Section IR-5.3.3.2. All element names
> thus modified with the ‘ide’ ending are given in Table IX.
> The stoichiometric name of the compound is then formed by combining the name of the
> electropositive constituent, cited first, with that of the electronegative constituent, both
> suitably qualified by any necessary multiplicative prefixes (‘mono’, ‘di’, ‘tri’, ‘tetra’, ‘penta’,
> etc., given in Table IV). The multiplicative prefixes precede the names they multiply, and are
> joined directly to them without spaces or hyphens. The final vowels of multiplicative prefixes
> should not be elided (although ‘monoxide’, rather than ‘monooxide’, is an allowed exception
> because of general usage). The two parts of the name are separated by a space in English.

> ### IR-5.3.3.2 Monoatomic anions
>
> The name ofamonoatomic anion is the element name (Table I) modified so as to carry the
> anion designator ‘ide’, either formed by replacing the ending of the element name (‘en’,
> ‘ese’, ‘ic’, ‘ine’, ‘ium’, ‘ogen’, ‘on’, ‘orus’, ‘um’, ‘ur’, ‘y’ or ‘ygen’) by ‘ide’ or by directly
> adding ‘ide’ as an ending to the element name.
